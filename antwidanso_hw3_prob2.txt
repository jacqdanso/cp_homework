\f0\fs24 \cf0 Formula 1 calculates the second root correctly, but is off by a small factor (-1.999e-6) on the first. With formula 2, it is the converse. The important thing to note is the difference between b and the discriminant. Since their difference is small, formula 2 should be used for root 1, and formula 1 for root 2. }
