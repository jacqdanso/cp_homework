HW for Computational Physics Course 

Branch : HW6 

pend.py is a python script that solves for the motion of a non-linear pendulum. 

Output files: 

antwidanso_hw6_prob1a.png - Plot of angular displacement of pendulum over time using the 4th order Runge Kutta. 

antwidanso_hw6_prob1b.png - Plot of angular displacement of pendulum over time using the Leap Frog Method. 

Video files : rk_movie.mov and lf_movie.mov for Runge-Kutta and Leap Frog, respectively. I could not save the animations from the Python script, so I took a screen recording instead. You can also see the animations by running the code.
