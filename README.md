HW for Computational Physics Course 

Branch : HW4 

These programs explore random number generation and integration of ill-behaved functions in Python. 

#Problem 1 
antwidanso_hw4_prob1.py simulates the decay of Bi-213 into Bi-209 and plots the numbers of each species involved. 

Output files:
antwidanso_hw4_prob1.py - plot of decay 

#Problem 2 
antwidanso_hw4_prob2b.py uses Monte Carlo integration to calculate the integral of (x^(-1/2))/((e^x)+1).

Output files: 

antwidanso_hw4_prob2.pdf - Derivation of transformation function, etc. 

antwidanso_hw4_prob2.txt.rtf - Txt file containing value of integral. 

Limitations: 
I define every function I use, which is redundant. I did this mainly for readbility. It was easier for me to spot any errors that way.
