HW for Computational Physics Course 
Branch : HW1 

The programs in this branch explore the fundamentals of computer programming, specifically the areas of binary notation and precision. 

#Problem 1
antwidanso_hw1_prob1.py accepts a user-specified positive integer in decimal and prints out its binary notation. It calculates the binary version using division by 2. 

Limitations: 
Does not compute binary notation for negative numbers. 

#Problem 2
antwidanso_hw1_prob2.py returns the altitude of a satellite given its orbit time in seconds. 

Limitations: 
It rejects negative numbers, but does not break out of the program (i.e. it attempts to compute something with negative time).
