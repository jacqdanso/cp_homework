HW for Computational Physics Course 

This branch contains programs and output files for HW5. 

#Problem 1 
antwidanso_hw5_prob1.py is a python script that fits a cosine function to data of temperature variation in Munich with time. 
antwidanso_hw5_prob1.png contains a plot of the data with the best-fit model. 
antwidanso_hw5_prob1.pdf contains answers to questions assessing the model. 

#Problem 2 
sloan.py fits different functions to data from specObj-dr13.fits. 
antwidanso_hw5_prob2.png is the output plot from sloan.py 
antwidanso_hw5_prob2.pdf contains the best-fit parameters for each model.
