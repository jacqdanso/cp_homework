HW for Computational Physics Course 
Branch : HW2 

The programs in this branch explore the use of basic operations and loops in Python. 

# Problem 1 
antwidanso_hw2_prob1.py accepts the speed of a spacecraft and outputs the times relative to observers aboard the spacecraft and those on Earth. 

# Problem 2
antwidanso_hw2_prob2.py accepts the mass and proton numbers of an atom and returns the binding energy of its nucleus. Some sections are purposely written line-by-line (e.g. constants a1 - a5) for readability. I'll stop doing this once I'm more proficient at Python.
